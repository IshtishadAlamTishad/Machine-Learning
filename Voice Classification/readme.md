## Problem Statement :
Motion Studios is the largest radio production house in Europe. It's total revenue is $1B+ . the company has launched a new reality TV show called "The Star RJ." The show is about finding a new radio jockey who will be the star presenter on upcoming shows. In the first round, participants will have to upload their voice clips online. The clip will be evaluated by experts for selection to the next round. There is a separate team in the first round for evaluation of male and female voices. Also, the response to the show  is unprecedented & the company is flooded with voice clips. As a result of all this,there is a need to classify the voice as either Male/Female so that the first level of filteration is quicker.
